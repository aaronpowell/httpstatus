## Tech

The site is .NET 7 and it is hosted as a [containerised Azure AppService](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/containers/?WT.mc_id=dotnet-00000-aapowell#overview).

## Self hosting

If you want, you are able to self-host the service using the provided image, which can be found [on GitHub packages](https://github.com/aaronpowell/httpstatus/pkgs/container/httpstatus). This may be useful for testing HTTP status codes which are not available in Azure, or time outs longer than we support in the hosted version.
